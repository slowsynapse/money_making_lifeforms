# SICA-Style Dashboard Progress Report

**Status**: Incomplete - UI working, CallGraph integration blocked by Docker architecture

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. SICA-Style Dashboard UI Created ✓
- **Location**: `sica_web/` directory
- **Files**:
  - `index.html` - Purple gradient header, responsive layout, two-tab interface
  - `dashboard.js` - Frontend logic with WebSocket support, callgraph polling, tree rendering
- **Features**:
  - Clean, modern UI with purple gradient header
  - Two tabs: "Execution & Callgraph" and "Cell Browser"
  - Four command buttons: Trading-Evolve, Trading-Learn, Trading-Test, Query Cells
  - Real-time event streaming via WebSocket
  - Execution tree visualization (ready for data)
  - Cell browser with filtering

### 2. SICA API Server Created ✓
- **Location**: `sica_api.py`
- **Port**: 8082 (original dashboard on 8081)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /` - Serves dashboard HTML
  - `GET /api/stats` - Cell statistics (working)
  - `GET /api/callgraph` - Callgraph proxy (implemented but no data source)
  - `POST /api/command/trading-evolve` - Command endpoint (stub)
  - `POST /api/command/trading-learn` - Command endpoint (stub)
  - `POST /api/command/trading-test` - Command endpoint (stub)
  - `GET /api/command/query-cells` - Cell query (working)
  - `WS /ws/events` - WebSocket event stream (working)

### 3. Integration Strategy Attempted
- Implemented HTTP proxy from port 8082 → port 8081 for callgraph data
- Added `httpx` for async HTTP requests
- Graceful fallback to empty callgraph when source unavailable

## Blockers Encountered

### Primary Blocker: CallGraphManager Architecture
**Problem**: The CallGraphManager runs inside Docker containers, not on the host.

**Root Cause**:
- `trading_api.py` (port 8081) doesn't have `/api/callgraph` endpoint
- Real callgraph data only exists inside Docker containers running with `--server` flag
- Host Python is broken, can't run `trading_api.py` modifications
- Docker container Python path issues prevented running persistent web server in container

**Evidence**:
```
/tmp/trade-api.log shows:
INFO: 127.0.0.1:xxxxx - "GET /api/callgraph HTTP/1.1" 404 Not Found
```

### Technical Challenges
1. **Broken Host Python**: Cannot modify or test Python code on host system
2. **Docker Module Path**: `python -m agent_code.agent` fails even with PYTHONPATH and cd workarounds
3. **Process Isolation**: CallGraphManager singleton lives in container process, not accessible from host

## What's Working

### Fully Functional
- ✓ Dashboard UI loads at http://localhost:8082
- ✓ Stats API shows cell counts and fitness metrics
- ✓ Cell browser tab queries and displays cells from database
- ✓ WebSocket connection established for real-time events
- ✓ All UI components render correctly
- ✓ Responsive layout with mobile support

### Partially Functional
- ⚠️ Command buttons trigger but don't execute actual Docker commands
- ⚠️ Callgraph endpoint returns empty data (no source available)
- ⚠️ Event streaming works but no events are generated

## What's Missing

### Critical
1. **CallGraph Data Source**: No way to access CallGraphManager from host API
2. **Command Execution**: Buttons don't actually run Docker commands
3. **Real-time Updates**: No mechanism to stream execution events from containers

### Architecture Options (Not Implemented)
1. **Shared State**: Could use Redis/database to share callgraph state between containers and host
2. **Container Web Server**: Run persistent web server inside container (blocked by Python path issues)
3. **File-Based**: Containers write callgraph JSON files, host API reads them
4. **Direct Integration**: Modify `trading_api.py` to add callgraph endpoint (blocked by broken host Python)

## Recommendations

### Short Term
1. **Document as incomplete**: This progress report
2. **Keep UI as reference**: The SICA-style interface is good example code
3. **Focus on original dashboard**: Port 8081 dashboard works with actual data

### Long Term (If Pursued)
1. **Fix Host Python**: Resolve Ubuntu Python installation issues
2. **Use File-Based Communication**: Containers write JSON, host reads it
3. **Implement Docker Command Execution**: Background task runner for command buttons
4. **Add Shared State Layer**: Redis or SQLite for cross-process communication

## Testing Instructions

```bash
# Start SICA dashboard
cd /home/masterpig2/kraken/master/self_improving_coding_agent
python3 sica_api.py

# Access dashboard
open http://localhost:8082

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8082/api/stats
curl http://localhost:8082/api/command/query-cells
```

## Conclusion

The SICA-style dashboard UI is **complete and functional**, but the **CallGraph integration is blocked** by architectural constraints (host Python broken, Docker process isolation, module path issues).

The dashboard serves as a good reference implementation for future work, but the **original dashboard on port 8081** should be used for actual trading operations since it has direct access to the cell database and doesn't require callgraph data.
