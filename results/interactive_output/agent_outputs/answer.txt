# Comprehensive Uptrend Trading Strategy

## 1. Entry Criteria
- **Primary Confirmation**: Price must be above both the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages (SMAs)
- **Secondary Confirmation**: RSI (Relative Strength Index) between 40-70 (showing strength without being overbought)
- **Entry Trigger**: Breakout above previous swing high with increased volume
- **Pattern Recognition**: Look for bullish chart patterns (ascending triangles, cup and handle, bull flags)
- **Moving Average Crossover**: 20-day SMA crosses above 50-day SMA (golden cross variation)

## 2. Exit Criteria
- **Profit Targets**: 
  - First target: 1.5× risk (take 30% of position)
  - Second target: 2.5× risk (take 40% of position)
  - Final target: 3.5× risk (take remaining 30%)
- **Stop Loss**: Below the most recent significant swing low
- **Technical Exits**:
  - Price closes below 50-day SMA for two consecutive days
  - RSI drops below 40
  - MACD crosses below signal line after extended uptrend
- **Time-Based Exit**: Exit if no progress toward profit target within 20 trading days

## 3. Risk Management Techniques
- **Maximum Risk Per Trade**: 1-2% of total trading capital
- **Maximum Portfolio Exposure**: No more than 20% in correlated assets
- **Scaling Out**: Use the tiered profit targets to gradually exit positions
- **Trailing Stop Loss**: After reaching first profit target, move stop loss to breakeven
- **Volatility Adjustment**: Use ATR (Average True Range) to adjust position size in more volatile markets
- **Correlation Analysis**: Reduce position size when trading multiple correlated assets

## 4. Position Sizing Recommendations
- **Base Position Size**: Risk amount ÷ (Entry price - Stop loss price)
- **Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing**: Reduce position size by 25% when ATR is 25% above the 20-day average
- **Conviction Levels**:
  - High conviction setup (all criteria met): 100% of standard position size
  - Medium conviction (most criteria met): 75% of standard position size
  - Lower conviction (minimum criteria met): 50% of standard position size
- **Scaling In**: Add to winning positions after a 1% move in favor, up to 150% of initial position size

## 5. Technical Indicators for Uptrend Confirmation
- **Moving Averages**: 20, 50, and 200-day SMAs aligned in ascending order
- **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**: MACD line above signal line and zero line
- **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**: Maintaining readings between 40-70
- **ADX (Average Directional Index)**: ADX > 25 indicates strong trend
- **On-Balance Volume (OBV)**: Rising OBV confirms price uptrend with volume support
- **Bollinger Band Expansion**: Widening bands indicate trend strength

## 6. Methods to Identify Potential Trend Reversals
- **Divergence Signals**: Price making higher highs while RSI or MACD makes lower highs
- **Candlestick Patterns**: Bearish engulfing patterns, evening stars, shooting stars
- **Volume Analysis**: Decreasing volume on rallies, increasing volume on pullbacks
- **Moving Average Violations**: Price closing below 50-day SMA for multiple sessions
- **Trend Line Breaks**: Break of major uptrend lines that have multiple touch points
- **Momentum Waning**: Decreasing rate of ascent in price action
- **Bollinger Band Contraction**: Narrowing bands suggesting decreased volatility before potential reversal

## 7. Practical Implementation Steps
1. **Market Analysis Phase**:
   - Scan for markets/assets showing uptrend characteristics using the indicators above
   - Create a watchlist of potential candidates
   - Rank opportunities by strength of trend and proximity to entry points

2. **Pre-Trade Planning**:
   - Calculate position size based on identified stop loss level
   - Determine the three profit targets
   - Document entry criteria and planned exit strategies

3. **Trade Execution**:
   - Enter positions when all criteria are met
   - Consider using limit orders at key technical levels
   - Split entries into 2-3 tranches if uncertain about exact entry point

4. **Position Management**:
   - Monitor positions daily using a trading journal
   - Adjust trailing stops as profit targets are reached
   - Review open positions weekly against original trend criteria

5. **Performance Review**:
   - Track win rate, average R-multiple, and maximum drawdown
   - Analyze losing trades for pattern recognition
   - Adjust strategy parameters quarterly based on performance metrics

## 8. Strategy Refinement
- **Market Regime Filters**: Reduce position size or avoid trading during high market volatility (VIX > 30)
- **Correlation Management**: Track correlation between positions to avoid overexposure
- **Sector Rotation Awareness**: Prioritize sectors showing relative strength to broader market
- **Fundamental Overlay**: Consider earnings dates and major announcements in timing decisions
- **Seasonal Tendencies**: Be aware of historical seasonal patterns that may affect trend strength
